# Serial.begin(115200); : the serial is a built in arduino communication object and the 115200 is the baud reate bits per second 
# the const int buffer_size = 64 is saying that we have a box that can hold to 64 letters it saves memory of the command
# the serial buffer is the same but each number is a small box that only holds one character
# the int bufferindex = 0 means that it starts at 0 the first position
# the SetPA level : is to control how strong the radio signal is 
    low is good for testing purposes but we might need to switch 
    to high or mid depending on the distance of the rover

# set Channel is like choosing a radio station 76 is the frequencu
    range is 0-125 both radios must use the same Channel

# Set data rate : how fast data is transmited
    250KBPS = 250 kb per second
    also both radios must use the same rate to Working

# enable dynamic paylods : allows sending different sized messages

# setRetries(a, b) : a = if message fails try n times and then b is
    how many units to wait between setRetries (5,15) are good 


## THE MAIN LOOP 
    this is what is collecting the data from the rover when the serial
    is avaliable and part 2 checks for the data from rover 


## Processing Commands 
    it stops listening so we can send the command to the rover 
    to get the data again and starts listening after


## Sending the telemetry 
    then it prints the telemetry that we got
