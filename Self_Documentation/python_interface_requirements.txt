# Python Interface Requirements for Ground Station Control

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation details for the Python interface that will control the Arc Jr rover using keyboard input.

## Required Python Packages
1. pyserial
   - Used for serial communication with Arduino
   - Install using: `pip install pyserial`

2. keyboard
   - Used for reading keyboard input
   - Install using: `pip install keyboard`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Serial Communication Setup
- Connect to Arduino using the correct port
- Use baud rate: 115200
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Example port names:
  - Windows: 'COM3'
  - Linux: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
  - Mac: '/dev/tty.usbserial-*'

### 2. Keyboard Control Mapping
- W: Send "FORWARD" command
- S: Send "BACKWARD" command
- A: Send "LEFT" command
- D: Send "RIGHT" command
- Space: Send "STOP" command
- Q: Quit program

### 3. Command Format
- Each command should be sent as a string followed by a newline
- Example: "FORWARD\n"
- Wait for Arduino confirmation before sending next command
- Handle command sending errors

### 4. User Interface
- Display current status
- Show which keys are being pressed
- Display command confirmation from Arduino
- Show error messages if something goes wrong

### 5. Error Handling
- Handle serial port connection errors
- Handle keyboard input errors
- Handle command sending failures
- Provide clear error messages to user

## Example Command Flow
1. User presses 'W' key
2. Python sends "FORWARD\n" to Arduino
3. Wait for "CMD_SENT:FORWARD" confirmation
4. If "CMD_FAILED" received, show error message

## Testing Requirements
1. Test all keyboard controls
2. Test error handling
3. Test command confirmation
4. Test program exit functionality

## Notes
- The Arduino is already set up to receive these commands
- Commands must be exact: "FORWARD", "BACKWARD", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "STOP"
- The Arduino will send back "CMD_SENT:" or "CMD_FAILED" for each command
- Add a small delay (0.1s) between commands to prevent command spam
